Sculpture Department Website.

The goal is to create a website that will be the dynamic public face for the RISD Sculpture Department that is easy for me, the faculty and the staff to update. The front page will aggregate basic information about the department, frequently updated news regarding the Sculpture Department community - faculty, students, visitors and staff, and list special events sponsored by the Sculpture Department. The website is intended as a way to communicate within the department, to the entire school and to the "outside world". Using Wordpress as a Content Management System (CMS) will insure that the site is easy to update and will provide timely content, useful to the RISD community.
